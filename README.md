## Brief Description

The 2019 Aeross Summer Courses cover all essential knowledge required to pursue projects like Nanosatellites, High Altitude Balloon and other educational aerospace projects and to start solving problems faced by the aerospace industry. The course was systematically designed and divided into relevant modules, covering Aerospace, Basics of Flight, Applications of Electronics in Aerospace and 3D Modelling.

## Need Statement

Making cubesats, launching a high altitude balloon and pursuing other aerospace projects require an understanding of complex ideas that one learns about at University, impelling all Aeross members to indulge in rigorous, extensive research. The journey is extremely arbitrary, and should be made systematic. To address this need, we decided to develop a free summer programme for our juniors to introduce them to relevant concepts.

## Teaching Methodology

We have tried to incorporate a few elements to our teaching methodology, which aren&#39;t present in other alternative sources of learning and which are paramount to what these courses intend to do.

- We not only educate them about physics concepts but also introduce them to its industrial application and the scope of their utilisation.
- The weekly assignments in which the questions made them explore more and give them an insight into what the industry is up to in that field of study.
- Problem-solving is incorporated into the curriculum by questioning them about their ideas to solve real-world problems the industry is facing today.

More than 80 students took this course. They read all modules given to them and then completed weekly assignments. They also clarified their doubts, and shared their ideas on [our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aeross/).
